# Hi, I'm Fatih Coşkun

Software Engineering student building practical software across iOS, Python, and Unity with a focus on clean, maintainable implementation.

## Focus
- iOS apps with SwiftUI and Core Data
- Python tools and data workflows with pandas
- Interactive prototypes with Unity and C#
- Clean code, version control, and maintainable project structure
